Share your data with your partners
==========================================

geOrchestra can implement a spatial data infrastructure to diffuse and share
data between partners and to all citizens (OpenData movement, INSPIRE Directive).

Its various modules can manage data : Catalog to search and find the data amond 
those wich are diffused, geospatial data server to distribute data in map form, 
extractor to recover data in a "standard" for reuse in a GIS editor, even to
edit the data.

All the modules are able to exchange informations between each other : catalog 
and viewer to provide available layers or retrieve metadata information, 
geospatial data server and viewer to display data in map form.

Join the community
========================

GeOrchestra project is a community project, its free license is a way to pool
development between the various contributors wishing to get involved in the project.

It is also a way to bring a community of customers in order to share applications.
